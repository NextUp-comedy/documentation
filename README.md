# Next Up User Manual

## Problem & **Solution**

- **Problem**
    
    **NextUp owner is struggling with**
    
    - Sharing revenue with their own customers.
    - Managing users they have and adding new users to the system.
    - Managing their content by searching over an excel sheet.
    - Matching each content with its user(s).
- **Solution**
    
    We built a Self Service Portal & Dashboard, whereas:
    
    Admin, can :
    
    - Automate all the financial operations.
    - Manage all existing users and add new users.
    - Match each content with its user(s).
    - see statistics of all users and for every single user, periodically reported.
    - see the payout request of each user and approve or reject them
    
    Users, can:
    
    - see their statistics [revenue, contents ]
    - manage his/her account [update profile, change password]
    - see the revenue of each content
    - ask for payouts
